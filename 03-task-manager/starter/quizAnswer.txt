    1. In order to access information from my .env file, I needed to have the dotenv package installed. 
    Fortunately, the package was already installed when I did `npm install`, so I skipped that part. 
    Then, I required the dotenv package in my app.js file and called the config method to load the variable `MONGO_URI` from the .env file into the app.js. 
    From there, I accessed the `MONGO_URI` using `process.env` as a parameter in my `connectDB` async function. 
    This allowed me to securely access the MongoDB database using the URI stored in the .env file.
    2. I ensure that the contents of my .env file are protected by adding it to .gitignore file.
